1. What is debounce function:-
Solution:- A debounce function is used to ensure that a particular function does not get called too frequently. 
           It is commonly used in scenarios where an action might be triggered multiple times in rapid succession, such as handling user input events like button clicks, key presses, or scrolling.
           The debounce function will limit the rate at which the function can be executed, ensuring it only runs after a specified amount of time has passed since the last invocation.

2. Create a count function like---------------"Closuer"
   count() // 1
   count() //2
   count.reset()
   count() // 1
   -------------Use iffi function --------
   const count = (() => {
    let id = 0;
    function counter() {
        id++;
        return id;
    }
    counter.reset = function() {
        id = 0;
    };
    return counter;
})();

// Testing the count function
console.log(count()); // Output: 1
console.log(count()); // Output: 2
console.log(count()); // Output: 3

count.reset(); // Resetting the counter

console.log(count()); // Output: 1
console.log(count()); // Output: 2
